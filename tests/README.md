# Tests

No dependencies to install. Two ways to run them.

## Logic tests (Node)

Covers the lesson state machine and the lesson content. Needs Node 22.7 or newer.

```bash
node --test "tests/*.test.js"
```

- `lesson-state.test.js` — the PRD's state rules: change selection before checking, no double scoring, advance only after checking, restart.
- `questions.test.js` — the content: five questions, four choices each, exactly one correct answer, matches the PRD appendix.

## Browser tests

Covers the screens, the real app, layout, accessibility, and color contrast.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173/tests/>. The page shows a pass, fail, or known-gap line per test and a summary at the top. The results are also on `window.__testResults`.

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `suite-component.js` | The question screen rendered directly: progress bar, choice and Check states, click handlers, HTML escaping, keyboard focus |
| `suite-e2e.js` | The real app clicked through: golden path, refresh, tampering, double submits, feedback speed, a seeded random walk |
| `suite-layout.js` | 320px to 1280px: no sideways scroll, 44px touch targets, clipped text |
| `suite-semantics.js` | Language tag, group name, non-color state symbols, screen reader text |
| `suite-contrast.js` | WCAG contrast in the light and dark theme |

A **known gap** (`todo`) runs and reports but does not fail the run. It records a real issue that the team has not fixed yet. When a known gap starts passing, the page says so: turn it into a normal test.

To add a suite, create `tests/suite-<name>.js`, register tests with `test(...)` from `harness.js`, and import the file in `browser-tests.js`.

No known gaps are open right now.
